# Process Scheduling Algorithm Simulator

This project is a web-based simulator for various CPU scheduling algorithms. It allows users to visualize and understand how different scheduling techniques manage process execution in a system. The supported algorithms include Round Robin (RR), First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN).

## Features

- **Interactive Interface:** Add processes with custom attributes such as arrival time and burst time.
- **Multiple Scheduling Algorithms:** Choose between Round Robin, FCFS, SJF, and SRTN.
- **Dynamic Gantt Chart:** Visualize the scheduling sequence of processes on a Gantt chart.
- **Ready Queue Visualization:** View the order of processes in the ready queue as they are scheduled.
- **Timestamp Tracking:** See the exact times when processes start and complete execution.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structure of the web application.
- **CSS3:** Styling for the interface, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
- **JavaScript:** Core functionality, including the implementation of scheduling algorithms.
